### GLSL Code can be found in the `IMAT3906-Shader-Programming\Shaders` folder

The application needs to be run in `x86` mode and you will need all of the texture files and models which aren't included due to their filesize, please contact me at `p16179167@my365.dmu.ac.uk` to get access to these files so the application will run. Alternatively, use your own files and put them in the respective files.
